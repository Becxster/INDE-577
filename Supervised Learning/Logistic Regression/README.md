# Logistic Regression

In this jupyter notebook, I explore the relationship between the eccentricities and perimeters, to classify rice into two species: Cammeo and Osmancik. 

## Rice (Cammeo and Osmancik) Dataset

**Description:**  
This dataset contains morphological measurements of two different types of rice grains: Cammeo and Osmancik. Each sample represents a single grain and includes various shape-related features extracted from images of the grains. The goal is often to distinguish between the two rice varieties based on these features.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Features:** Morphological attributes such as area, perimeter, and axis lengths of the rice grains.
- **Classes:** Two categories (Cammeo and Osmancik).
- **Use Cases:**  
  - Classification tasks to identify rice varieties.
  - Exploring shape analysis methods and image-based feature extraction.
  - Benchmarking supervised learning algorithms for binary classification.

**Data Source:**  
UCI Machine Learning Repository ([Rice Cammeo and Osmancik Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik))
