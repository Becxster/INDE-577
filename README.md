This repository includes projects conducted for INDE 577: Data Science & Machine Learning @ Rice University. Each concept contains a jupyter notebook walkthrough outlining the machine learning technique. Feel free to modify and experiment with any and all notebooks â€” this repository is intended for public use. 

The concepts covered in this repo include:

### **Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps input data to output labels or values, using labeled datasets.

1. **The Perceptron**: A fundamental linear classifier for binary classification problems.
2. **Linear Regression**: Predicts continuous values by modeling relationships between features and a target variable.
3. **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification by modeling the probability of a class using a logistic function.
4. **Neural Networks**: A powerful algorithm for learning complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs.
5. **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple algorithm that classifies a point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.
6. **Decision Trees / Regression Trees**: Tree-based models for classification and regression tasks that split the data based on feature thresholds.
7. **Random Forests**: An ensemble of decision trees that reduces overfitting and improves accuracy.
8. **Other Ensemble Methods, including Boosting**: Techniques like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting that combine weak learners into a strong predictive model.

### **Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised learning identifies patterns and structures in unlabeled datasets.

1. **K-Means Clustering**: Groups data points into clusters based on feature similarity using a distance metric.
2. **DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters of arbitrary shapes and marks outliers as noise.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality by finding directions of maximum variance in the data.
4. **Image Compression with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Compresses images by decomposing them into singular values and selecting the most significant components.
